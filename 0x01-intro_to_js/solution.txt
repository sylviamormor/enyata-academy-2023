Question 1
'let' 'var' and 'const' are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The difference t
hat let allows for variable reassignment, while const creates a variable with a constant 
(unchanging) value and var creates variables you can use anywhere inside the function.

Question 2

After defining a variable, we can use it by referencing its name in our code. 

Question 3
We can declare a string by enclosing the text within either 
single quotes (') or double quotes ("). 
For example:
 let myString = 'Sylvia';

Question 4
Yes, we can create strings with either single or double quotes. Both are valid ways to 
define a string in JavaScript.

Question 5
"9" with quotes is a string literal, representing the character sequence "9". 
It is treated as a string type in JavaScript.

9 without quotes is a number literal, representing the numeric value 9. 
It is treated as a number type in JavaScript.

Question 6

Declaration: 
Declaring a variable involves introducing the variable name to the JavaScript environment. 
It tells the interpreter that the variable exists and may be used later.

Redeclaration: 
Redeclaration refers to declaring a variable that has already been declared before. 
In JavaScript, variables declared with let and const cannot be redeclared within the same scope,
while variables declared with var can be.

Assignment:
Assigning a value to a variable involves giving the variable a value for the first time
or changing its existing value. It is done using the assignment operator (=).

Reassignment:
Reassigning a value to a variable means changing the existing value of the
variable to a new value. It is also done using the assignment operator (=), 
but on a variable that has already been declared and assigned a value.
